> With the release of [Alpine 3.x](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine-next), Spruce has been replaced with a first-party [`$store`](https://alpinejs.dev/magics/store) helper, as well as [`Alpine.store`](https://alpinejs.dev/magics/store). This package will continue to support Alpine 2.x, but only with security releases. I want thank everyone who has used and supported this packages development over the last couple of years, it really does mean a lot. ‚ù§Ô∏è
